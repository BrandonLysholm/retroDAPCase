Overall Issues:
- top and bottom do not line up properly`


Bottom Issues:
- DAC volume knob did not have clearance
- RPi was too close to DAC and did not properly clear the outputs - doesn't matter with redesign 
- not enough depth for PCB, DAC, and screen - need to add about 2-3mm

Top Issues:
- not tall enough - issue with the sketch
- lip too close to left side - issue with the sketch
- clickwheel mounts are off
- charge ports are off

New Design Changes:
- mount RPi and hold switch to top, making the two pieces easily seperable.


Parts that worked well:
- Heated inserts fit well
- RPi mounts were properly spaced
- the recess for charger PCB was properly sized
- bottom length was well sized
- switches holes were well sized
